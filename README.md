### The Builder, Factory, and Abstract Factory design patterns
A melhor explicação que li sobre o Builder Pattern é encontrada no exemplo 2, uma pequena explicação..

>There are a lot of similarities between a Builder design pattern and the Abstract Factory design pattern, which is a creational pattern that can be used to provide an interface to create instances of classes that belong to related classes without having to specify their implementations. In essence, the Abstract Factory design pattern is used to create a factory of factories.

>In the Abstract Factory design pattern, the consumer invokes the Factory methods to create the objects. In the Builder design pattern, the Builder class creates an object depending on the information it receives, but the object creation process is abstracted. The Factory design pattern is a simplified form of the Builder pattern. In essence, you would want to use the Builder design pattern when you need to create a complex object in a step by step manner. When you create a simple object using just one method, you would need to take advantage of the Factory Method design pattern. The Abstract Factory design pattern is useful when you need to create objects using multiple factory methods.
